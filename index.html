    <h1>JavaScript Promises</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Promise</strong> is an object representing the current state of an
      asynchronous operation. <br /><br />It serves as a wrapper for a value
      that is not known when the promise is created. <br /><br />This approach
      enables handling the results of asynchronous operations as if they were
      synchronous: instead of directly returning the result of the asynchronous
      operation, a promise for the future result is provided.
    </p>

    <h2>1. States of a Promise</h2>
    <p>A promise can assume one of three states:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pending:</strong> The initial state upon creating a promise.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Fulfilled:</strong> Indicates that the operation was completed
        successfully, yielding some result.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Rejected:</strong> Signifies that the operation was unsuccessful
        and was rejected with an error.
      </li>
    </ul>
